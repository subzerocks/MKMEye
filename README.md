Sell your Magic cards on (Magic) Cardmarket (https://www.cardmarket.com) by scanning your cards with image recognition.

This software allows you to identify cards by image recognition, match them to the MKM stock and directly sell them on the marketplace, making adding bulk cards to MKM as easy as possible.

#### What do I need for this?

This software (free!) and a good webcam like this one here:

[IPEVO Ziggi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01530XGMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01530XGMA&linkCode=as2&tag=alexanderp-20&linkId=0e80c25c2467c0d816207d1b9b76d77b)

I used a cheaper 10 Eur webcam (HD) mounted on an old candelabra during the initial development, but it focused badly and was nowhere as good as the Ziggi. Ironicly it seems TCG uses the same cam for their TCGPro product.

##### How much is it?

The software is free!

##### Can you provide you a always up2date database of cards for it?

I try my best but the tool to build an up2date database is included, you can build a very nice db using the ccghq xlq images yourself.

#### Quick Start & Downloads

Here are some working binaries and the needed assets for your enjoyment. These are not updated with every push so this version might be a bit outdated towards the real source version:

Latest Binary Version:

- [MKMEye 02.b](https://www.alexander-pick.com/github/MKMEye-02b-Release_07102017.rar)

The download includes a refrence DB from the day one of MTG to the end of 2016.

#### The GUI has 5 Hotkeys

- (q) check the cam identified card against the mkm database, the mkm match will be shown in the top right corner
- (w) If the identified card is not yours or a reprint of the target, use this key to iterate through the possible matches
- (s) Put the card on MKM for sale, the card will be listed on MKM directly
- (l) add to List

I am using MKMEye regulary at the moment and it works very well for me. I hope you enjoy this software as much as I do.

### But Why?

If I feel lucky and buy a collection to merge into mine I usally end up with a lot of bulk. You know these cards not really worth much. But selling it usally is a lot of work since you have to add each card and ship it. So why not skipping at least one of the parts if its possible? This is how this project started. I was searching the web upside down for a good solution and found quite a few image recognition projects, but they were all very basic at this point. I found this rather old project public domain project by Peter Sterm realeased on reddit. It was written in C# using AForge for image detection and had the needed basics for my idea. This is how this started, based on the original Magic Vision this pretty advanced project developed, I have to say I am a little bit pround of it. 

At the moment my personal goal is to sell that much Bulk that way so that I can get some nice graded Antiquities or other vintage cards for my collection.

### How to get it working

#### Running MKMEye

1.) Compile or download the MKMEye

2.) Change the config and add your MKM Api Key

3.) Start scanning and selling

### Some Notes

- I tried to only match the art and the full card image. From various tests I decided to go with matching the full card, it works pretty well.
- If you need a tool to crop art from images anyways, i.e. the widly known xlhq images, it is included in this repo too. For the process is has not much use anymore.
- Tool adds articles with MKM AVG prices, if you are luck, this works very well with the price update of my MKMTool project which could be found here: https://github.com/alexander-pick/MKMTool
- Creating the DB might take an hour or two. Don't be afraid if the tool is not responding, I didn't pay much attention to make it fancy task supported, but it will work.
- Watch what you add to MKM, don't blame me if you add something twice or somethign wrong - this tool does not replace a brain.
